| INSTALLING THE LIBRARY FOR EXTERNAL USAGE |
---------------------------------------------

The Makefile in src/ provides all that is needed to build the library. For
testing purposes, you can run

$ make [gnu|intel|pgi|nag|cray]

to build with a specific compiler using pre-set compiler flags. However, if
you want to build MARBL to link with an outside program, you may want more
control over the compile-time options. To that end, run

$ make OBJ_DIR=[location of object files] depends
$ make [desired_location_of_lib]/libmarbl.a \
       USE_DEPS=TRUE \
       FC=[compiler] \
       FCFLAGS="[compiler flags]" \
       OBJ_DIR=[location of object files] \
       INC_DIR=[location of .mod files]

The first call will produce the dependency file (shared_deps.d), the second call
will build libmarbl.a and the *.mod files. When building the GCM, you will need
to add

-I$(INC_DIR)

And when linking

-L$(LIB_DIR) -lmarbl
